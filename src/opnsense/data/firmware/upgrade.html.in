<p>OPNsense %%CORE_SERIES%% "<em>%%CORE_NICKNAME%%</em>" has reached its end
of life. As such it will not receive any more updates, but the upgrade to the
new %%CORE_NEXT%% series is seamless and can be performed right here from the
web GUI.</p>
<p> Another method is to import and reinstall using a new installation image,
which will retain your settings using "Import Configuration", then reformat
the disk and apply a clean system using either "Install (UFS)" or "Install
(ZFS)".</p>
<p>You can also upgrade via console / SSH by using option 12 from the menu by
typing "%%UPGRADE_RELEASE%%" when prompted.</p>
<p>Make sure to read the migration notes and adjust for possible breaking changes:</p>
<ul><li>This release contains a new major operating system version and should be carried
out with the necessary care. Despite extended test coverage changes made by FreeBSD may
still affect operation without our knowledge.  Except for ZFS boot environments rollbacks
between major operating system versions are extremely fragile and a reinstall of an older
version should be attempted in the worst case.</li>
<li>IPsec hash and cipher removals in FreeBSD 13 can affect existing setups as insecure
cryptographic options have been removed upstream. If you are using MD5, Blowfish, DES, 3DES
or CAST128 in your phase 2 please move to more secure settings prior to the upgrade.</li>
<li>The Realtek vendor driver is no longer bundled with the updated FreeBSD kernel. If unsure
whether FreeBSD 13 supports your Realtek NIC please install the os-realtek-re plugin prior to
upgrading to retain operability of your NICs.</li></ul>
<p>Please backup your configuration, preview the new version via live image or
in a virtual machine. Create snapshots. If all else fails, report back
<a href="https://forum.opnsense.org/" target="_blank">in the forums</a> for
assistance.</p>
